This rem folder holds two of the REM application interfaces with ProtoMol.  

The sequential version was our first implementation for execution on a single machine.

The qsub version runs independent copies of ProtoMol at each step via a queing interface.

The MPI version can be found in the protomol/applications/rem* directory
