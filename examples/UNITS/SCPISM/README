* Scheme: Langevin Dynamics with SCPISM Forces                           *
* System: 22-atom, unsolvated, Alanine Dipeptide                         *
* Purpose: Tests Langevin integrator and SCPISM algorithms               *
*          On this one a lot of the integrator and force information     *
*          is the same as the other tests, but the point is to test the  *
*          calculation of SCPISM forces                                  *

Parameters, descriptions, and acceptable values

GENERAL:
1. doscpism
	VALUES: true or false
	DESCRIPTION: True if SCPISM calculations are being used.  The program should crash elegantly with a message if this is false but SCPISM forces are computed.


INTEGRATOR PARAMETERS:
1. timestep
	VALUES: (0, ~3.2]
	DESCRIPTION: Timestep for propagation in femtoseconds

2. temperature
	VALUES: positive integer
	DESCRIPTION: Used as a scaling factor when adding white noise forces.  Higher values just mean higher magnitudes for these forces, yielding more rapid energy changes
3. gamma
	VALUES: nonnegative floating point
	DESCRIPTION: Frictional coefficient
4. seed
	VALUES: nonnegative integer
	DESCRIPTION: Random number seed for calculating random white noise force.


1. switchingFunction
	VALUES: Universal, C1, C2, Cn, CmpCnCn, Shift
	DESCRIPTION: Since a cutoff is being used, apply a function to smooth its value to zero at the cutoff distance.  Universal is no smoothing, C1 is a continuous first derivative and C2 continuous second, Cn is flexible continuity, CmpCnCn is its complement, Shift is a PE shift.  These in turn accept different parameters
2. switchon
	VALUES: floating point, < cutoff
	DESCRIPTION: Angstrom distance at which switching turns on
3. switchoff
	VALUES: floating point, > 0
	DESCRIPTION: Angstrom distance at which switching turns off
4. cutoff
	VALUES: floating point, > 0
	DESCRIPTION: Angstrom distance to cutoff forces and assume zero
