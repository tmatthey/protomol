Parameters, descriptions, and acceptable values

GENERAL:
1. eigfile
	DESCRIPTION: Binary file of eigenvectors for Hessian computation in the Normal Mode calculations
	VALUES: system-specific, DO NOT VARY


TRAJECTORY OUTPUT:
1. dcdfile: Name of the binary DCD trajectory output file of atomic positions


INTEGRATOR PARAMETERS:
NormModeMin:
1. timestep
	VALUES: (0, ~17.0]
	DESCRIPTION: Timestep for propagation in femtoseconds
2. minimlim
	VALUES: positive integer
	DESCRIPTION: The minimizer contains a target potential energy; this is the target difference between that value and the current potential energy.
3. avModeMass
	VALUES: [0, 102.1]
	DESCRIPTION: For mass-reweighted minimization, the average mode mass
4. forcePEcheck
	VALUES: true (default) or false
	DESCRIPTION: Checks force and potential energy after each minimization loop cycle, prints a message upon failure
5. randforce
	VALUES: true (default) or false
	DESCRIPTION: Whether or not to add a random force
6. rediag
	VALUES: true or false (default)
	DESCRIPTION: Force a rediagonalization if the target potential energy was missed on this iteration.

NormModeInt:
1. cyclelength
	VALUES: integer (0, 4]
	DESCRIPTION: Number of times to run the inner integrator per iteration of the outer
2. fixmodes
	VALUES: integer (0, 66)
	DESCRIPTION: Number of high frequency modes to constrain.
(This propagator runs Langevin dynamics as does BBK, so the next three parameters come from this.)
3. temperature
	VALUES: positive integer
	DESCRIPTION: Used as a scaling factor when adding white noise forces.  Higher values just mean higher magnitudes for these forces, yielding more rapid energy changes
4. gamma
	VALUES: nonnegative floating point
	DESCRIPTION: Frictional coefficient
5. seed
	VALUES: nonnegative integer
	DESCRIPTION: Random number seed for calculating random white noise force.
6. nve
	VALUES: integer
	DESCRIPTION: If non-zero, run an NVE simulation
7. Berendsen
	VALUES: nonnegative floating point
	DESCRIPTION: If positive, apply a Berendsen thermostat
8. fdof
	VALUES: integer (0, fixmodes]
	DESCRIPTION: Number of fixed degrees of freedom
	

FORCE PARAMETERS
The NonbondedCutoff algorithm makes the following parameters available.
Other algorithms have different parameters available.  For more information,
view: http://protomol.sourceforge.net and download Quick Reference 2.0.3 or
run 'protomol -f'.
In addition, 'protomol -i' gives a list of available integrators and parameters.

1. switchingFunction
	VALUES: Universal, C1, C2, Cn, CmpCnCn, Shift
	DESCRIPTION: Since a cutoff is being used, apply a function to smooth its value to zero at the cutoff distance.  Universal is no smoothing, C1 is a continuous first derivative and C2 continuous second, Cn is flexible continuity, CmpCnCn is its complement, Shift is a PE shift.  These in turn accept different parameters
2. switchon
	VALUES: floating point, < cutoff
	DESCRIPTION: Angstrom distance at which switching turns on
3. switchoff
	VALUES: floating point, > 0
	DESCRIPTION: Angstrom distance at which switching turns off
4. cutoff
	VALUES: floating point, > 0
	DESCRIPTION: Angstrom distance to cutoff forces and assume zero
