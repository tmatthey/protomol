Parameters, descriptions, and acceptable values

GENERAL:
1. numsteps 
	DESCRIPTION: number of simulation steps
	VALUES: nonnegative integers
. firststep 
	DESCRIPTION: number of the first step
	VALUES: nonnegative integers
3. exclude
	DESCRIPTION: When computing pairwise forces, atom pairs that are covalently bonded within this distance are excluded. 1-2 excludes atoms directly bonded, 1-3 excludes atoms which are bonded to a shared atom, etc.  scaled1-4 is a bit less drastic than 1-4, including 1-4 interactions but scaling them down as opposed to completely excluding them
	VALUES: none, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, scaled1-4
4. posfile
	DESCRIPTION: Protein Data Bank file for atomic positions
	VALUES: system-specific, DO NOT VARY
5. psffile
	DESCRIPTION: Protein Structure File
	VALUES: system-specific, DO NOT VARY
6. parfile
	DESCRIPTION: CHARMM parameter file
	VALUES: system-specific, DO NOT VARY
7. temperature
	DESCRIPTION: Kelvin temperature
	VALUES: 0-1000
8. seed
	DESCRIPTION: Random number seed (affects any calculations throughout the simulation which involve random numbers, i.e. velocity initialization)
	VALUES: nonnegative integers
9. outputfreq
	DESCRIPTION: Frequency to perform trajectory output
	VALUES: positive integer
10. boundaryConditions 
	DESCRIPTION: Spatial boundary conditions (periodic boundary conditions perform a wraparound at the edges of a 'periodic box' representing Cartesian space.  
	VALUES: Periodic or Vacuum
11. cellBasisVector[1,2,3] (Only for Periodic boundary conditions)
	DESCRIPTION: Three vectors which span the periodic box in Cartesian space.  If atoms move outside this box, their positions will wraparound. Commonly basis vector 1 will have its x-coordinate set to the x-dimension of the periodic box, vector 2 will have its y-coordinate set to the y-dimension, and vector 3 will have its z-coordinate set to the z-dimension.  If omitted, these vectors will span space defined by the maximum x, y, and z initial coordinates, plus a small buffer zone
	VALUES: Positive floating point values, but if they are very large the boundary conditions are essentially reduced to Vacuum
12. cellManager
	VALUES: Cubic
	DESCRIPTION: Shape of cells for nonbonded force computation, as of now Cubic is all that's available so do not vary.
13. cellsize
	VALUES: Positive integer
	DESCRIPTION: The size of these cubic cells in angstroms.  Cartesian space becomes subdivided into cubic cells of this size, and when pairwise forces are computed, all atoms within a specific cell are evaluated with all atoms within neighboring cells.  Thus, good practice is to enforce cellsize >= 0.5*cutoff.
14. removeLinearMomentum
	VALUES: -1, 0, or positive integer frequency
	DESCRIPTION: Frequency at which to remove COM translational momentum from atomic velocities.  -1 is never, 0 is only at the beginning, otherwise a frequency in timesteps
15. removeAngularMomentum
	VALUES: -1, 0, or positive integer frequency
	DESCRIPTION: Frequency at which to remove COM rotational momentum from atomic velocities.  -1 is never, 0 is only at the beginning, otherwise a frequency in timesteps.



TRAJECTORY OUTPUT (all strings for filenames).  Many of these are readable and plottable through MATLAB.
(Note, you can append these suffixes to the following parameters to achieve the following:
outputfreq: Positive integer frequency for the number of steps between writes.
cachefreq (positive integer), cachesize (nonnegative integer): For ProtoMol output, a cache is kept which holds necessary data for each type of file.  cachefreq is the frequency at which this cache should be flushed, and cachesize is the size in bytes.  These can be used to maximize performance for large scale systems with few file writes (i.e. large amounts of time between writes)
closetime: (nonnegative integer), Temporarily closes file after this number of steps following a write.

1. allenergiesfile: Writes a file containing step number and values for all types of energy
2. bsdlfile: Writes a BSDL file of atomic positions, visualizable through BOOGA
3. diffusionfile: Writes a file containing time in femtoseconds, the average rate of diffusion in cm^2/s, volume, temperature, and atomic density in kgm^-3*1e3
4. dihedralsfile: Writes a file containing dihedral angle values for the dihedral number passed in 'dihedralindex'.
5. momentumfile: Writes a file containing linear and angular momentum for the atoms
6. tempfile: Writes a file containing Kelvin temperature
7. xyzbinposfile: Writes a binary XYZ trajectory file of atomic positions 
8. xyzbinvelfile: Writes a binary XYZ trajectory file of atomic velocities
9. xyzforcefile: Writes an XYZ trajectory file of atomic forces
10. xyzposfile: Writes an XYZ trajectory file of atomic positions
11. xyzvelfile: Writes an XYZ trajectory file of atomic velocities

12. screen: A unique trajectory output, set to true or false if output should be displayed to the screen


INSTANTANEOUS OUTPUT (all strings for filenames).  

1. finPDBPosFile: PDB file of final atomic positions
2. finXYZBinPosFile: Binary XYZ file of final atomic positions
3. finXYZBinVelFile: Binary XYZ file of final atomic velocities
4. finXYZBinVelRevFile: Binary XYZ file of final atomic velocities, negated
5. finXYZPosFile: XYZ file of final atomic positions
6. finXYZVelFile: XYZ file of final atomic velocities



INTEGRATOR PARAMETERS:
1. timestep
	VALUES: (0, ~2.8]
	DESCRIPTION: Timestep for propagation in femtoseconds
2. temperature
	VALUES: positive integer
	DESCRIPTION: Used as a scaling factor when adding white noise forces.  Higher values just mean higher magnitudes for these forces, yielding more rapid energy changes
3. gamma
	VALUES: nonnegative floating point
	DESCRIPTION: Frictional coefficient
4. seed
	VALUES: nonnegative integer
	DESCRIPTION: Random number seed for calculating random white noise force.
